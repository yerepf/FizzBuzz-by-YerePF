I didn’t know what to do because I didn’t have wifi and I was so bored, so I did the famous ‘FizzBuzz Exercise’. 
My main programming language is C#, so I used it. 
I tried to create an application with upgradable code by separating the user’s interaction from the business logic.

PD: Sorry for bad English, I'm learning yet. je, je, je.
